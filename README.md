## NodeJS Application for purposes creating Optimizely Fullstack experiments

### Pre-requisites
- NodeJS [Documentation here](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- JavaScript(ES6)
- A/B testing [Read about A/B testing here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)
- [OptimizelyX Account](https://www.optimizely.com/)
- Optimizely's SDK [Documentation here](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/welcome)

### How to get started
1. Clone this repo, and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `yarn start` to run nodemon script

### Purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to re-iterate launching fullstack experiments using Optimizely. Fullstack experimentation is useful for:    
- Feature rollouts
- A/B/n testing
- Tracking user events that are parallel to server-side functionality (eg. form submisisons)

#### To Do 
- Complete a basic experiment using this NodeJS application
